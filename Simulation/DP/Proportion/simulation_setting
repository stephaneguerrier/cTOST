DP Two-Sample Proportion Equivalence Test Simulation
=====================================================

Purpose: Evaluate Type I error rates at boundary cases

Design Parameters:
- alpha = 0.05 (significance level)
- epsilon = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 (privacy budget, 6 values)
- n1 = n2 = 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 (sample sizes, 9 values)
- p1 = 0.5, 0.65, 0.8 (first sample proportion, 3 values)
- Equivalence bounds: lower = -0.1, upper = 0.1

Scenarios (Type I error at boundary):
1. p2 = p1 + 0.1 (true difference p1 - p2 = -0.1, at lower bound)
2. p2 = p1 - 0.1 (true difference p1 - p2 = +0.1, at upper bound)

Total Settings: 6 × 9 × 3 × 2 = 324
Monte Carlo Iterations: 10,000 per setting
SLURM Jobs: 30 batches per setting = 9,720 jobs total
Iterations per Job: ~334

Total Simulations: 324 × 10,000 = 3,240,000
