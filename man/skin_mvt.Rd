\title{Multivariate measurements for log-transformed cutaneous delivery of econazole (ECZ) from bioequivalent products on porcine skin}
\format{
A `data.frame` with 12 rows and 4 columns:
\describe{
  \item{`stratum corneum`}{Differences of log-transformed econazole nitrate delivery for the two creams across the stratum corneum (0-20 μm).}
  \item{`viable epidermis`}{Differences of log-transformed econazole nitrate delivery for the two creams across the viable epidermis (20-160 μm).}
  \item{`upper dermis`}{Differences of log-transformed econazole nitrate delivery for the two creams across the upper dermis (160-400 μm).}
  \item{`lower dermis`}{Differences of log-transformed econazole nitrate delivery for the two creams across the lower dermis (400-800 μm).}
}

\usage{
data(skin_mvt)
}
\description{
Original data were collected using the cutaneous biodistribution method described in Quartier et. al. (2019),
and represents cutaneous delivery of econazole nitrate (ECZ in ng/cm^2) on porcine skin from a reference medicinal
product and an approved bioequivalent product across multiple skin layers (from the surface to a depth of approximately 800 μm).
The dataset contains differences of log-transformed measurements of ECZ deposition for the two creams,
across 12 comparable porcine skin samples and four anatomical regions.
